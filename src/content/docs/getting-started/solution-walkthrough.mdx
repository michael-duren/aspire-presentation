title: Solution Walkthrough
description: Walking through the .NET Aspire solution

import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import { FileTree } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

We've created a new aspire starter application.
The solution explorer should look something like this:

<FileTree>

- Walkthrough.ApiService/
- Walkthrough.AppHost/
- Walkthrough.ServiceDefaults/
- Walkthrough.Web/

</FileTree>

## App Host

The Orchestration project `AppHost` is the entry point and where we
configure our services, databases, and other resources.
As I mentioned before if you've used ASP.NET Core's `WebHostBuilder`
this will feel very familiar.

We can see that the template creates a `DistributedApplicationBuilder`
and adds our projects to the builder.
To add a project we use the `AddProject` method, and pass
the project reference which we get from the `Projects`
metadata object as the generic argument. As long as the `AppHost` has a reference to
the project in the `Walkthrough.AppHost.csproj` file
our projects will appear as properties from the `Projects` global object.

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var apiService = builder.AddProject<Projects.Walkthrough_ApiService>("apiservice");

builder.AddProject<Projects.Walkthrough_Web>("webfrontend")
    .WithExternalHttpEndpoints()
    .WithReference(apiService);
```

![project metadat](/project-meta.png)

We can see that when calling `AddProject` the method
it will return a `IResouceBuilder<ProjectResource>`,
the `ProjectResource` is specific to adding .NET projects,
but the [`IResourceBuilder`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/aspire.hosting.applicationmodel.iresourcebuilder-1?view=dotnet-aspire-8.0&viewFallbackFrom=net-8.0)
interface is used for all resources. We can then pass
our returned `IResourceBuilder` to other projects as references.
This is happening in the above code where we pass the `apiService`
to the `webfrontend` project. This will handle the networking
between the two projects, similar to a docker compose
configuration:

```yaml
services:
  apiService:
    image: ${DOCKER_REGISTRY-}walkthrough_apiservice
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: ApiService/Dockerfile
  webFrontend:
    image: ${DOCKER_REGISTRY-}walkthrough_webfrontend
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: WebFrontend/Dockerfile
    depends_on:
      - apiService
```

## Running the AppHost

Finally in the `Program.cs` file of the `AppHost`
we see the call to build and run the Distributed Application:

```csharp
builder.Build().Run();
```

Before getting into the Service Defaults project, lets
run the `AppHost` and take a look at the .NET Aspire dashboard.

Making sure the `AppHost` project is the startup project
either hit `F5` or run `dotnet run` from the `AppHost` directory.

![runnning apphost](/run.png)

After starting `AppHost`, a browser window should open
which is directed to the Aspire dashboard.

<Aside>
Similar to ASP.NET Core applications the launch settings
for different debug and run configurations can be found
in the `Properties/launchSettings.json` file. If you
don't want the random port number you can always assign
one your prefer.

You also have access to the `appsettings.json` file
through the `builder.Configuration` property which implements
the `IConfigurationManager` and `IConfiguration` interfaces.

</Aside>

## The Dashboard

The dashboard has a lot of information about the state
of our services, events, logs, health checks, and
links to launch swagger or frontend projects.
If we click on the `https` link for the `webfrontend`
project we're brought to a typical Blazor application.

If we check the `Program.cs` file in the `Web` project
we can see a base address is being added to a http client
service

```csharp
builder.Services.AddHttpClient<WeatherApiClient>(client =>
    {
        // This URL uses "https+http://" to indicate HTTPS is preferred over HTTP.
        // Learn more about service discovery scheme resolution at https://aka.ms/dotnet/sdschemes.
        client.BaseAddress = new("https+http://apiservice");
    });
```

We'll get into how this works in the next section, but
for now by checking the `GetWeatherAsync` method of the `WeatherApiClient`
we can see that the `Web` project is getting its weather information
from the `ApiService` service.

```csharp
await foreach (var forecast in httpClient.GetFromJsonAsAsyncEnumerable<WeatherForecast>("/weatherforecast", cancellationToken))
{
    if (forecasts?.Count >= maxItems)
    {
        break;
    }
    if (forecast is not null)
    {
        forecasts ??= [];
        forecasts.Add(forecast);
    }
}

return forecasts?.ToArray() ?? [];
```

In the web browser click the Weather link in the Blazor
app and return to the dashboard.
We've triggered requests from both services so there should be information
to view in the different tabs.

- `Console` - Shows the same logs you would see in the terminal
  when running a .NET application.
- `Structured` - Shows logs which can be filtered by keywords,
  log levels, categories, services, and more as well as a
  details tab with more information about the log.
- `Metrics` - Shows the metrics for the different services
  and can be filtered by service. There are options
  to view metrics in a graph or table format.
- `Traces` - Shows the traces of the requests that have been made
  to the services. An incredibly useful tab for debugging, we can see
  when we navigated to Weather tab and even click into the details
  view to see a waterfall chart of the different requests made.

## Service Defaults

Each service project in your aspire solution should have a reference
to the `ServiceDefaults` project. The extension method `builder.AddServiceDefaults()`
should be called by each service which adds the following:

- OpenTelemetry metrics and tracing (a lot of what we just went through
  in the dashboard).
- Default health check endpoints.
- Service discovery functionality.
- Configures `HttpClient` to work with service discovery.

If we look at the `AddServiceDefaults()` method
we can see the previously mentioned features
being added.

```csharp
public static IHostApplicationBuilder AddServiceDefaults(this IHostApplicationBuilder builder)
{
    builder.ConfigureOpenTelemetry();

    builder.AddDefaultHealthChecks();

    builder.Services.AddServiceDiscovery();

    builder.Services.ConfigureHttpClientDefaults(http =>
    {
        // Turn on resilience by default
        http.AddStandardResilienceHandler();

        // Turn on service discovery by default
        http.AddServiceDiscovery();
    });

    return builder;
}
```
