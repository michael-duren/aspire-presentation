Although we don't have time to build a project from scratch
we can go through one a small one I have built.
`100Days` is a simple application that gives users the
option to create a goal of doing something everyday for
100 days. Inspired by the 100 Days of Code challenge
on twitter the app is supposed to help users continue
to create goals and learn new things.

The frontend application is a react app served with
the `Vite` server and includes a `Dockerfile` to
serve via nginx.

The code can be found [here](https://github.com/michael-duren/100-days).
Please keep in mind a lot of this code is for examle use
and not production ready.

## App Host

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var secrets =
    builder.ExecutionContext.IsPublishMode
        ? builder.AddAzureKeyVault(name: "secrets")
        : builder.AddConnectionString("secrets");

var username = builder.AddParameter("username", secret: true);
var pwd = builder.AddParameter("password", secret: true);

var messaging = builder
    .AddRabbitMQ("messaging")
    .WithManagementPlugin();

builder.AddProject<Projects.User_Email>("consumers")
    .WithReference(messaging);

var authdb = builder
    .AddPostgres(
        name: "auth",
        port: 5433,
        userName: username,
        password: pwd
    )
    .AddDatabase(name: "authdb", databaseName: "100days_auth");

var authService = builder
    .AddProject<Projects.Auth_Api>("authapi")
    .WithReference(messaging)
    .WithReference(secrets)
    .WithReference(authdb);

var goaldb = builder
    .AddPostgres(
        name: "goal",
        port: 5434,
        userName: username,
        password: pwd
    )
    .AddDatabase(name: "goaldb", databaseName: "100days_goal");

var goalService = builder
    .AddProject<Projects.Goal_Api>("goalapi")
    .WithReference(messaging)
    .WithReference(secrets)
    .WithReference(goaldb);

var entrydb = builder
    .AddPostgres(
        name: "entry",
        port: 5435,
        userName: username,
        password: pwd
    )
    .AddDatabase(name: "entrydb", databaseName: "100days_entry");

var entryService = builder
    .AddProject<Projects.Entry_Api>("entryapi")
    .WithReference(messaging)
    .WithReference(secrets)
    .WithReference(entrydb);

// apply migrations
builder.AddProject<Projects.Auth_MigrationService>("auth-migration").WithReference(authdb);
builder.AddProject<Projects.Goal_MigrationService>("goal-migration").WithReference(goaldb);
builder.AddProject<Projects.Entry_MigrationService>("entry-migration").WithReference(entrydb);

builder
    .AddNpmApp("react", "../100days.client", "dev")
    .WithReference(authService)
    .WithReference(goalService)
    .WithReference(entryService)
    .WithEnvironment("BROWSER", "none")
    .WithHttpEndpoint(env: "PORT")
    .WithExternalHttpEndpoints()
    .PublishAsDockerFile();

builder.Build().Run();
```

With the exception of RabbitMQ, Azure Key Vault and the migration services
we've already seen a lot of the code in the previous
example.

This application uses Azure Key Vault to store signing crednetials
for the asymetric jwt authentication, a very simple use case for RabbitMQ
and the migration services to apply the migrations to the databases.
We'll go over each individually.
