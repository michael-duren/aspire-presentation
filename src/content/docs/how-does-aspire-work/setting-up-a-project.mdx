import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

There are multiple ways we can setup a new Aspire project.
We can setup a new one from scratch, or use the Visual Studio/CLI
to add aspire to an existing project.

For demo purposes we will create a new project from scratch, but
you can find the tutorial for adding aspire to an existing project
[here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/get-started/add-aspire-existing-app?tabs=unix&pivots=visual-studio).

## Environment Setup

### Workload

<Aside>
  If you are using .NET 9+ Aspire comes bundled with the SDK and you can skip
  this step./Aside>
</Aside>

For dotnet 8, you will need to install a dotnet workload.
You can see your existing workloads `dotnet workload list` and
install the aspire workload with `dotnet workload install aspire`.
For Mac/Linux you need to run these commands with `sudo`.

After installation you should see a list like this after running
`dotnet workload list`.

```bash
Installed Workload Id      Manifest Version       Installation Source
---------------------------------------------------------------------
aspire                     8.2.0/8.0.100          SDK 8.0.100
maui                       8.0.72/8.0.100         SDK 8.0.100
```

If you want to upgrade to .NET 9 and remove the workload you can
run `dotnet workload uninstall aspire`.

### Docker

An OCI compliant container runtime is required, I use
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) although there is support for [Podman](https://podman.io/).
If you want to use Podman instead of Docker you can check out the Microsoft documentation
[here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/fundamentals/setup-tooling?tabs=linux&pivots=visual-studio#container-runtime).
All resources that are not .NET Projects are run in containers.

### IDE

- Visual Studio 2022 includes .NET Aspire templates,
  and additional context menu options specific to Aspire.
- Jet Brains Rider now has Aspire support bundled and does not require
  installation of an additional plugin.
- Visual Studio Code has the C# Dev Kit: Extension, which
  should have LSP support for Aspire, although templates and
  other features are done through the CLI.

Because I use Rider, I will include screenshots for UI setup
as well as the CLI.

## Creating a project

### Templates

![.NET Aspire Templates](/aspire-templates.png)

.NET Aspire provides two projects: `AppHost` and the `ServiceDefaults`
projects. The templates give you the following options:

1. `Starter App` - Creates a solution with the two projects that also contains
   example frontend and backend projects.

2. `Empty App` - Just contains the two projects.
3. `App Host` & `Service Defaults` - Individual aspire projects.

If we run `dotnet workload list | grep aspire` we can see the
same projects as the image above.

```bash
.NET Aspire App Host                      aspire-apphost              [C#]
.NET Aspire Empty App                     aspire                      [C#]
.NET Aspire Service Defaults              aspire-servicedefaults      [C#]
.NET Aspire Starter App                   aspire-starter              [C#]
.NET Aspire Test Project (MSTest)         aspire-mstest               [C#]
.NET Aspire Test Project (NUnit)          aspire-nunit                [C#]
.NET Aspire Test Project (xUnit)          aspire-xunit                [C#]
```

We'll pick the starter app with the name `Walkthrough` and click `Create`
or run:

```bash
dotnet new aspire-starter -n Walkthrough -o ./Walkthrough
```

### Walkthrough

#### App Host

The Orchestration project `AppHost` is the entry point and where we
configure our services, databases, and other resources.
As I mentioned before if you've used ASP.NET Core's `WebHostBuilder`
this will feel very familiar.

We can see that the template creates a `DistributedApplicationBuilder`
and adds our projects to the builder.
To add a project we use the `AddProject` method, and pass
the project reference which we get from the `Projects`
metadata object as the generic argument. As long as the `AppHost` has a reference to
the project in the `Walkthrough.AppHost.csproj` file
our projects will appear as properties from the `Projects` global object.

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var apiService = builder.AddProject<Projects.Walkthrough_ApiService>("apiservice");

builder.AddProject<Projects.Walkthrough_Web>("webfrontend")
    .WithExternalHttpEndpoints()
    .WithReference(apiService);
```

![project metadat](/project-meta.png)

We can see that when calling `AddProject` the method
it will return a `IResouceBuilder<ProjectResource>`,
the `ProjectResource` is specific to adding .NET projects,
but the [`IResourceBuilder`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/aspire.hosting.applicationmodel.iresourcebuilder-1?view=dotnet-aspire-8.0&viewFallbackFrom=net-8.0)
interface is used for all resources. We can then pass
our returned `IResourceBuilder` to other projects as references.
This is happening in the above code where we pass the `apiService`
to the `webfrontend` project. This will handle the networking
between the two projects, similar to a docker compose
configuration:

```yaml
services:
  apiService:
    image: ${DOCKER_REGISTRY-}walkthrough_apiservice
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: ApiService/Dockerfile
  webFrontend:
    image: ${DOCKER_REGISTRY-}walkthrough_webfrontend
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: WebFrontend/Dockerfile
    depends_on:
      - apiService
```

#### Running the AppHost

Finally in the `Program.cs` file of the `AppHost`
we see the call to build and run the Distributed Application:

```csharp
builder.Build().Run();
```

Before getting into the Service Defaults project, lets
run the `AppHost` and take a look at the .NET Aspire dashboard.

Making sure the `AppHost` project is the startup project
either hit `F5` or run `dotnet run` from the `AppHost` directory.

![runnning apphost](/run.png)

After starting `AppHost`, a browser window should open
which is directed to the Aspire dashboard.

![aspire dashboard](/dashboard-projects.png)

<Aside>
Similar to ASP.NET Core applications the launch settings
for different debug and run configurations can be found
in the `Properties/launchSettings.json` file. If you
don't want the random port number you can always assign
one your prefer.

You also have access to the `appsettings.json` file
through the `builder.Configuration` property which implements
the `IConfigurationManager` and `IConfiguration` interfaces.

</Aside>

#### The Dashboard

The dashboard has a lot of information about the state
of our services, events, logs, health checks, and
links to launch swagger or frontend projects.
If we click on the `https` link for the `webfrontend`
project we're brought to a typical Blazor application.

If we check the `Program.cs` file in the `Web` project
we can see a base address is being added to a http client
service

```csharp
builder.Services.AddHttpClient<WeatherApiClient>(client =>
    {
        // This URL uses "https+http://" to indicate HTTPS is preferred over HTTP.
        // Learn more about service discovery scheme resolution at https://aka.ms/dotnet/sdschemes.
        client.BaseAddress = new("https+http://apiservice");
    });
```

We'll get into how this works in the next section, but
for now by checking the `GetWeatherAsync` method of the `WeatherApiClient`
we can see that the `Web` project is getting its weather information
from the `ApiService` service.

```csharp
await foreach (var forecast in httpClient.GetFromJsonAsAsyncEnumerable<WeatherForecast>("/weatherforecast", cancellationToken))
{
    if (forecasts?.Count >= maxItems)
    {
        break;
    }
    if (forecast is not null)
    {
        forecasts ??= [];
        forecasts.Add(forecast);
    }
}

return forecasts?.ToArray() ?? [];
```

In the web browser click the Weather link in the Blazor
app and return to the dashboard.
We've triggered requests from both services so there should be information
to view in the different tabs.

- `Console` - Shows the same logs you would see in the terminal
  when running a .NET application.
- `Structured` - Shows logs which can be filtered by keywords,
  log levels, categories, services, and more as well as a
  details tab with more information about the log.
- `Metrics` - Shows the metrics for the different services
  and can be filtered by service. There are options
  to view metrics in a graph or table format.
- `Traces` - Shows the traces of the requests that have been made
  to the services. An incredibly useful tab for debugging, we can see
  when we navigated to Weather tab and even click into the details
  view to see a waterfall chart of the different requests made.
  ![traces](/traces.png)

#### Service Defaults

Each project in your aspire solution should have a reference
to the `ServiceDefaults` project. The extension method `builder.AddServiceDefaults()`
is available to add service defaults to each service.
The code below is the default implementation of the `AddServiceDefaults` method.

```csharp
public static IHostApplicationBuilder AddServiceDefaults(this IHostApplicationBuilder builder)
{
    builder.ConfigureOpenTelemetry();

    builder.AddDefaultHealthChecks();

    builder.Services.AddServiceDiscovery();

    builder.Services.ConfigureHttpClientDefaults(http =>
    {
        // Turn on resilience by default
        http.AddStandardResilienceHandler();

        // Turn on service discovery by default
        http.AddServiceDiscovery();
    });

    return builder;
}
```
