Aspir8 is a tool created by the .NET community
that handles the generation of deployment YAML
based on the app host manifest.

To install:

```bash
dotnet tool install -g aspirate --prerelease
```

To update:

```bash
dotnet tool update -g aspirate --prerelease
```

If we navigate to our earlier example of
`Walkthrough.AppHost` we can try to
generate our `.yaml`.

`cd Walkthrough.AppHost && aspirate generate`

After answering the questions from the CLI
it should generate several folders with
the necessary yaml.

We can additionally run the kubernetes
cluster by running

`aspirate run`

And the following should be visible in
Docker Desktop or wherever you are running
you're running your cluster.
