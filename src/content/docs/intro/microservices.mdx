## Introduction

Before we can dive into .NET Aspire it's important we review
Microservices and Cloude Native Architecture.

## Cloud Native Computing

A [definition](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/DEFINITION.md) of Cloud Native Computing from [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/):

> Cloud native practices empower organizations to develop, build, and deploy workloads in computing environments (public, private, hybrid cloud) to meet their organizational needs at scale in a programmatic and repeatable manner. It is characterized by loosely coupled systems that interoperate in a manner that is secure, resilient, manageable, sustainable, and observable.
> Cloud native technologies and architectures typically consist of some combination of containers, service meshes, multi-tenancy, microservices, immutable infrastructure, serverless, and declarative APIs — this list is non-exhaustive.

The 5 pillars of cloud native computing are (according to [Google](https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-is-cloud-native?hl=en)):

1. **Microservices**: Applications are broken down into smaller, loosely coupled services.
2. **Containers & Orchestration**: Containers are used to package and deploy applications,
   and orchestration tools are used to manage containerized applications.
3. **DevOps**: Development and operations teams work together to deliver software faster and more reliably.
4. **Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery**: Automating the process of testing and deploying code,
   helping teams deliver software faster and more reliably.

Cloud native computing offers many advantages, a few are listed below:

- Scalability: Cloud native applications can scale up or down based on demand.
- Resilience: Cloud native applications are designed to be resilient to failures.
- Agility: Cloud native applications can be developed, tested, and deployed quickly.

But with these advantages come added complexity, as cloud native applications
grow, managing them can become more difficult. Developers need also rethink
the way we build applications, and convincing different teams to make the move
can be difficult. This is where tools like .NET Aspire can help.

## What are Microservices

A simple definition of microservices: an application that
is comprised of other smaller applications (services).

A more accurate defintion: Microservices are
an architectural style where an application is structured
as a collection of independently deployable, loosely coupled
services. These services are organized around business capabilities,
own their data, and are completely indepedent of each other.

### Organizing Services

Figuring out how to split up your microservices
can be difficult. A good rule of thumb is to organize
your services around business capabilities or logical
operations.
Domain Driven Design (DDD) is a good approach to
first focus on your business domain and then split
your services based on that.
Applying the SRP (Single Responsibility Principle) to
your services can also help you split them up.

### Ownership of data

One of the key principles of microservices is that
each service owns its own data. This means that
services can easily be scaled independently.

### Independence

The services in a microservices architecture are
completely indepedent of each other. Depedending
on the size of the application and organization
you may have several teams working on different
services.

Services could be written with
different tech stacks, programming languages,
and even hosted on different platforms, though you probably don't
want to go too extreme with this. Sticking to
a few programming languages and tech stacks depdending
on the organization is a good idea.

Services can also be setup in your CI/CD
pipeline to deplopy independently, allowing
teams to deploy their services quickly without affecting
other services.

## Event Driven Architecture (EDA)

Even though our services are indepdent of each other
we still need a way for them to interact with each other.
While RESTful APIs are a common way to communicate, using
message brokers like Kafka, RabbitMQ, Azure Service Bus can be a better
approach.

If you are familiar with the mediator pattern, this is similar
in the way it reduces coupling by having an intermediary handle
the communication. The microservices do not "know" about each other,
they simply must have the ability to react to messages that are sent from
the message broker.

**Advantages of using EDA include:**

- Decoupling between services
- Asynchronous communication - non blocking calls from producers
  and consumers.

**Messages that are sent between services are usually:**

- Commands: A message that tells a service to do something.
- Events: A message that tells a service that something has happened.
- Can contain data (JSON string, bytes, etc) or be empty.

**Events can further be broken down into:**

- Domain events: Events that are specific to a domain.
- Integration events: Events that are used to communicate between services.
- There are other types of events but these are the most common.

In EDA the message broker is a single point of failure and can become
the bottleneck of your application. This should
be taken into considertation and have a high amount of
resilience in place. If you are using a cloud provider
like Azure, AWS, or GCP they have services that can
help mitigate these risks by offering managed message broker
services with built-in resilience,
high availability, and fault tolerance. For example, Azure offers Azure Service Bus,
AWS provides Amazon SQS and Amazon SNS, and GCP has Pub/Sub.
These services are designed to handle large-scale workloads,
ensure message durability, and automatically recover from failures.

### Overview of the Publish-Subscribe Pattern

There are many ways to implement EDA, but one of the most common
implementations is the Publish-Subscribe pattern.
Publishers send messages to a message broker and subscribers
consume these messages.

<div class="rounded-md mx-auto p-8">
  <img src="/pub-sub.png" alt="pub sub" class="rounded-lg" />
</div>

This pattern allows for multiple subscribers to listen to the same
messages and react to them accordingly. Additional filtering can
be applied to reduce the number of messages a subscriber receives.
This is an implementation detail we will go over in a later section.
For now understanding that messages are sent to a message broker,
and distributed to subscribers (services) is how we can communicate
in a loosely coupled manner.

Pictured below is a use case when a new user regsiters for our application there
might be several actions that need to take place. The services can handle
that same event independently in this case sending an email, setting up the users
default todo reminders and a default user goal.

<div class="rounded-md mx-auto p-8">
  <img src="/pub-sub-2.png" alt="pub sub" class="rounded-lg" />
</div>

### Event Sourcing Pattern

An advantage of using EDA is that you can implement the Event Sourcing
Pattern to have a log of events that have happened in your system.
This is adventageous for many reasons, including:

- A single source of truth: You can use the events to rebuild the state of your system
  at any point in time.
- Debugging: Of course being able to move back in time to see exactly what happened
  is a great way to debug issues.
- Auditing: You can see who did what and when.

There are some caveats to using Event Sourcing, including the complexity
and something called eventual consistency. Eventual consistency means
that data will be consistent at some point in the future, but not
outright. The delay in consistency can be milliseconds to seconds,
of course the goal being to minimize this delay.

### The Death Star

If you decide to not use EDA and have services communicate
directlly with each other you run the risk of creating
a tightly coupled interdependent system. This is known
as the Death Star anit-pattern.

It might be okay for smaller projects (technically the example
application does this) but as your application grows to 100s
of microservices you can create a mess of dependencies, which
are hard to manage, deploy, and scale effictively removing the
advantages of using a microservices architecture.

Pictured below is an example which would be hard to untagle!
Just like a drawer of unmanaged cables, but much worse.

  <img src="/ball-of-mud.jpg" alt="pub sub" class="rounded-lg" />
</div>

## The Gateway Patterns

Gateways can provide a single entry for your frontend
to interface with simplifying the communication between
your backend services.
These gateways can also handle authentication, logging,
caching, and other cross-cutting concerns. This allows
aggregating responses and translating one external request
into many internal ones, even the ability to translate a request
into different protocols.

For the sample application we will not be using a gateway,
I have configured the vite dev server to proxy requests
to the appropriate services, and the nginx docker file
to do the same.

Similar to the message broker, the gateway can become
a bottle neck, and single point of failure
so having a high amount of resilience is important.

There are multiple ways to implement a gateway, these
patterns can be mixed and matched to fit your needs
they include:

- Gateway Routing Pattern: A gateway that routes requests
  by the frontend directly to internal services, this is
  what most people think of when they hear gateway.
- Gateway Aggregation Pattern: A gateway that aggregates
  responses from multiple services into a single response.
- Backend for Frontend Pattern: A gateway that is specific
  to a frontend, this is useful when you have multiple
  frontends that require different data or capabilities.
- Gateway Offloading Pattern: A gateway that offloads
  cross-cutting concerns like authentication, logging,
  and caching from the services.

Cloud gateways that are currently available include:
Azure Application Gateway, AWS API Gateway, and GCP API Gateway.
If you want to deploy and fine grain control of your gateway
you can use libraries like:

- [Ocelot](https://ocelot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction/gettingstarted.html): A open-source
  .NET API gateway which includes support for routing,
  request aggregation, and authentication, load balancing, and more.
- [YARP](https://microsoft.github.io/reverse-proxy/): Developers love
  their acronyms, YARP stands for Yet Another Reverse Proxy (similar to YAML in naming).
  The library was developed by Microsoft and is a reverse proxy that can accomplish
  many of the same tasks as Ocelot.
- [Envoy](https://gateway.envoyproxy.io/): A high performance C++ distributed
  proxy designed for single services and applications, as well as a communication bus
  and “universal data plane” designed for large microservice “service mesh” architectures.
