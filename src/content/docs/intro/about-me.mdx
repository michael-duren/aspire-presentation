## About Me

I am a software developer and engineer based in Twin Cities MN.
I got into the tech space about 3 years ago and since have enjoyed the journey,
continuously learning and growing as a developer by learning new technologies,
languages, making mistakes and building projects.

I specialize in C# .NET, Typescript, React, and RDB Databases.
My tech interests outside of work include learning lower level languages like C,
building tools with Go Lang, and creating developer tools.

When I'm not coding I'm running, lifting weights, volunteering,
or spending time with family and friends.
