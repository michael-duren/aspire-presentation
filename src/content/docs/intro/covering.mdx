Buliding applications using microservices can be done many ways,
with many different pieces of technology.. Even using .NET Aspire
we could still use different languages for our frontend, databases,
messaging strageties, etc.

My goal here is not to dive deep into every part of
microservices but to focus on what .NET Aspire is, how it works,
and the problems it solves. I am new to the world of
microservices and cloud-native so if you see something
here that you think could be better or isn't a great approach
please let me know.

  Since .NET 9 was just released there have been some new Aspire features and
  updates to setting the development environment. We will not be covering theses
  in detail, but I will bring them up when necessary.
