## Overview

Buliding applications using microservices can be done many ways,
with many different pieces of technology.. Even using .NET Aspire
we could still use different languages for our frontend, databases,
messaging strageties, etc.

My goal here is not to dive deep into every part of .NET Aspire &
microservices but to show an approach I used and give an overview of how you can
get started with your own projects. I am new to the world of
microservices and cloud-native design so if you see something
here that you think could be better or isn't a great approach
please let me know.
