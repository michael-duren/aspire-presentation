# Building with .NET Aspire

## Introduction

This repository contains the documentation for my presentation
on building with .NET Aspire. This presentation is intended to
walk you through a (very) short introduction to microservices,
cloud native computing, and how .NET Aspire can help you build
distributed systems.

If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me
at any of my socials you can find on my GitHub profile.

Suggestions please create an issue or PR, I'm always happy to
take feedback and improve my content.

Thank you for your time.
